### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned how to use the the getElementById() method to access the elements from the index.html to the id. The getElementById() method allowed me to      access the expense amount the user entered.
2. I learned how to use use the parseFloat() method to convert the expense strings to floats. I had to do this to be able to convert the expenses to         numbers since you cannot use the letters from the strings in mathematical equations.  
3. I learned how to insert a clear form button.
